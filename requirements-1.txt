# These standard modules get marked as required by 'pip freeze' due to Python
# 2.7's standard module packaging. These will not be marked as required if
# Python 3.3+ is used.  We document the minimum required versions  here just for
# completeness, and so future users understand why these might appear in the
# 'pip freeze' output.
# argparse==1.2.1
# wsgiref==0.1.2

# This module sometimes gets marked as required by 'pip freeze' since it is a
